A tag is a special keyword enclosed in angle brackets (< >) that is used in HTML (HyperText Markup Language) to define the structure and meaning of content on a webpage.

ðŸ‘‰ In simple words:

A tag tells the browser what the content is (like a heading, paragraph, image, link, etc.).

Tags usually come in pairs:

Opening tag â†’ <p>

Closing tag â†’ </p>
Together, they form an element:

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

Types of Tags

Container tags (have opening & closing)
Example:

<h1>Hello</h1>


Empty (self-closing) tags (no closing needed)
Example:

<br>   <!-- Line break -->
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Example">   <!-- Image -->





Here, <h1>, <p>, <br>, <img> are tags.
